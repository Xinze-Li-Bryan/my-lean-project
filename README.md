# ðŸ“š My Lean Project

A comprehensive journey through **Theorem Proving in Lean 4** â€” rebuilt from the ground up, theorem by theorem, idea by idea.

---

## âœ¨ Purpose

This project is a **personal reimplementation** of all core contents in *Theorem Proving in Lean 4*.  
It is not just a review â€” it's a **reconstruction**.

> Rewriting proofs to rewrite thinking.  
> A new foundation for rigorous formal mathematics.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Structure

- Each file corresponds to a chapter or concept from the book  
- Proofs are adapted, clarified, sometimes extended  
- Comments are added where intuition or interpretation is needed

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/) (latest version)  
- [lake](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/build/) (Leanâ€™s build tool)

**To run locally:**

## ðŸ§  Why Rebuild It?

Because true understanding comes from **reconstruction**.
By rewriting the formal proofs, I aim to:

* Deepen my structural understanding of Lean
* Internalize the philosophy of type theory
* Prepare for advanced formalization projects in pure mathematics

## ðŸŒ± For You

Feel free to **clone**, **fork**, **study**, or **challenge** the proofs.
I welcome feedback, corrections, or collaborations â€” especially if you're also walking the Lean path.
